# Heatwave Overheating Pipeline
## Overview
This repository provides a research-oriented data processing and analysis pipeline for assessing the impacts of heatwaves on indoor overheating, cooling energy demand, and human physiological heat stress in residential buildings. The framework integrates climate data, building energy simulation outputs, and human thermoregulation modeling (JOS-3), enabling comparative analyses across climates and heatwave definitions.
